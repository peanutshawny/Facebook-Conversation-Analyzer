#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze my message history with important people in my life, most notably my girlfriend. I downloaded all my messages from Facebook to accomplish this feat.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Analysis
* Json Manipulation
* Sentiment Analysis

### Technologies/Languages
* Python & Jupyter Notebook
* NLTK 
* SpaCy
* Gensim 

## Project Description
Me and my girlfriend of around 5 months constantly debate over our history of chatting with each other. This includes when we actually started "talking", who made the first move, topics that were talked about, etc. 

I then thought it'd be really interesting if I somehow took all the messages we sent each other (we mostly used Facebook Messenger) and did an analysis on our message history. Luckily for me, Facebook has a feature where you can download all (and I mean ALL) of your personal data that you accumulated on the platform. Having known my girlfriend for over three years at university, it'd be interesting to compare our messaging behaviour before/after we started dating, in addition to exploring some sentiment analysis and more complicated NLP stuff later on.
